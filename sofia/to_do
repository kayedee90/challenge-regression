# Review the number of elements in each class
# Target column is the target variable, the one we are trying to predict
# Numerical columns and Categorical columns 
# For categorical values we can look at the distribution of values (e.g. how many men/women) so we can find imbalances
# Training a model with data imbalances can cause disproportioned prediction errors for the under-represented groups
# Having redundant (or highly correlated) columns can be a problem for machine learning algorithms.
