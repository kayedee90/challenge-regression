## feedback

- excellent readme, it's good to explain what everyone has done
- good code, efficient model, slight overfitting but nothing too bad that's good work
- good project architecture with logical folders, thanks
- You could have removed the project guidelines (not necessary here but ok)
- good idea to put the slides deck here
- Not necessary to have 1 folder per person you could have kept 1 branch per person, it would have been cleaner
- why is "cleaned_data_for_model.csv" here? not used? 
- What you've done is not completely clear but clear enough, try making things as easy to read and understand as possible for someone else
- The final code could have been more OOP compliant (there is only 1 main function instead of several specific ones)
- Missing docstring and dynamic typing
- I can see chatgpt comments and emojis btw

Overall this project is complete, good work :fire: 
You can focus on improving OOP, code architecture and make sure the final branch only displays what's really important (final code, dataset,...). git commits are there if I want to look the history. Otherwise good git usage, merges and commits.
Good team work!
